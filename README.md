<h1 align="center">HealthHub-Web üè•</h1>

## Project Overview

HealthHub-Web is a backend web service built using Laravel 10.X. The project's primary purpose is to manage medical appointments, making it easier for both patients and doctors to navigate the healthcare system.

## Key Features

1. **Appointment Management**: The application allows doctors to manage their available appointment slots, which can then be viewed and booked by patients. This streamlines the appointment scheduling process, reducing the burden on both parties.

2. **Email Notifications**: The system can send email confirmations to patients when an appointment is booked or rescheduled. It also provides the ability for patients to cancel their appointments via email.

3. **Doctor Availability**: Doctors can set their own schedules and availabilities, ensuring that patients can easily find and book appointments that fit their needs.

4. **Improved Patient-Doctor Interaction**: By centralizing the appointment management process, HealthHub-Web facilitates better communication and coordination between patients and their healthcare providers.

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel 10.X**: A robust PHP framework for building modern web applications.
- **MySQL**: The relational database used to store and manage patient, doctor, and appointment data.
- **PHPMailer**: A library for sending email notifications from the application.
